      <h1>DMH: Verbs</h1>
      <p>Some of the Aspects used for Dead Man's hands are pretty straightforward. ADJECTIVES add a +1 to your flip if it's a character quality that's relevant enough to help you and a -1 if relevant enough to hurt you. Similarly, You can Add a +1 to your flip if the action falls within your NOUN or BACKGROUND's wheelhouse: You'd benefit from being an ACADEMIC if you were sticking your nose into a book for hours on end to study up on a vampire's weakness. It's less helpful if you're in the middle of a bar fight.</p>
      <p>Verbs are a bit trickier. Most verbs are often more evocative and more specific that the other aspects. They also imply that your character can do something you might not have otherwise thought of. Aspects describe your character, so if your VERB is "Exorcises Witches", then you can assume your character knows 1) That witches exist and can be exorcised and 2) the rituals and materials necessary to do so. Below are descriptions for the verbs mentioned in the previous post.</p>
      <h2>Verbs</h2>
      <p>Consider these descriptions "rules". Unless your group brews up their own ruling, you have access to the abilities and knowledges described in each section in addition to the single phrase that's added to your character sheet (note to self: make a character sheet).</p>
      <h3>Speaks for the Flame</h3>
      <p>Your character can hear voices in mundane flames. Whether they are individual voices or echoes from a singular source you are unsure, but you are certain they want you to listen. As long as you obey, you are bestowed with the ability to manipulate fire.</p>
      <h3>Worships December</h3>
      <p>You are an acolyte of December, the spirit of frost. You have the ability to create and manipulate ice. Your religion is taboo, but you know how to contact others who believe as you do and form a clandestine network.</p>
      <h3>Employs Smoke and Mirrors</h3>
      <p>You can create illusions to fascinate and deceive. This can be through elaborate mechanisms and slight of hand or real, hand-to-heart magic. </p>
      <h3>Lives in the Shadows</h3>
      <p>While others merely adopted the dark, you were born into it. As such, you are supernaturally stealthy. You can manipulate shadows to conceal yourself or others.</p>
      <h3>Invents Machinery</h3>
      <p>You have the ability to pull ideas from your mind and transform them into steam powered, metal clad constructs that do your bidding. With enough time and materials you can create anything you can imagine. With even more time and materials you can make it work most of the time.</p>
      <h3>Makes things Explode</h3>
      <p>You know what makes things tick. Given enough opportunity you can make explosives from just about anything.</p>
      <h3>Tames the Wild</h3>
      <p>You've experienced enough hardship to know how to survive in the wild. You can hunt, fish, trap, homestead, and anything else you might need to do to live away from society. You can track anyone who's travelled through your homelands.</p>
      <h3>Leads the Pack</h3>
      <p>You can speak to, and control, animals. Most characters with this ability have a stronger and more dependable bond with specific animals or types of animals, but some generalists are content dealing with animals as equals.</p>
      <h3>Hunts the Undead</h3>
      <p>You are trained in recognizing, tracking, and destroying the undead scourge that plagues the land. While some undead are obvious, you know that the more dangerous pests hide among and feed on the living. You are immune to a single power that an undead monster might possess and resistant, through training or bloodline, to some others.</p>
      <h3>Talks to the Dead</h3>
      <p>Through years of study and practice, you've mastered the ability to summon the dead. You cannot fail, though you cannot guarantee the disposition of the summoned either. Study might determine whether a spirit's motives align with yours, and offerings might bridge the gap.</p>
      <h3>Gambles with Their Life</h3>
      <p>Your unique talent lies in making and enforcing deals. When bets are placed, contracts signed, or agreements sealed with a handshake, the universe enforces the terms, rendering them unbreakable or imposing severe consequences for violators. The intricacies of these deals rest solely between you and the GM.</p>
      <h3>Reads the Future</h3>
      <p>Somehow, you get glimpses of the future. These glimpses are often mundane and unhelpful, but with effort you can glean specific or meaningful information from the omens you find. This is risky, as your glimpses can be misleading or dangerous.</p>
      <h3>Propagandizes</h3>
      <p>You possess a silver tongue and the ability to shape the thoughts and beliefs of those around you. Whether through stirring speeches, persuasive pamphlets, or charismatic rallies, you can manipulate public opinion and incite movements. Your words carry a supernatural weight, weaving through the minds of your audience like a subtle enchantment.</p>
      <h3>Seduces</h3>
      <p>You are a master of allure, able to beguile and manipulate others through your charm and charisma. Whether for information, favors, or simply to have your way, your enchanting presence can bend the wills of those who fall under your seductive influence. Be cautious, though, as the power of attraction can be a double-edged sword.</p>
      <h3>Sings like an Angel</h3>
      <p>Your voice has a divine quality that can inspire hope, heal wounds, and uplift spirits. Whether in hymns or ballads, your singing has a soothing and transformative effect. In dire situations, your melodic tones may even attract celestial beings or protective spirits to aid you and your allies.</p>
      <h3>Plays Like the Devil</h3>
      <p>You are a virtuoso with a dark twist, able to play haunting melodies that tap into the supernatural. Your music can summon otherworldly entities, induce fear, or even curse those who listen. The haunting notes of your instrument carry an eerie resonance that leaves a lasting impression on both the living and the dead.</p>
      <h3>Dabbles in the Occult</h3>
      <p>You have delved into forbidden knowledge, gaining the ability to perform occult rituals and spells. Whether drawing upon ancient texts or channeling dark energies, your command over the arcane allows you to uncover hidden truths, hex your enemies, or unleash eldritch forces upon the world.</p>
      <h3>Exorcises Witches</h3>
      <p>As a skilled witch hunter, you specialize in identifying and expelling supernatural entities. Your training and rituals make you a formidable foe against practitioners of the dark arts. Armed with sacred symbols and ancient rites, you can purify spaces, dispel curses, and banish malevolent spirits.</p>
      <h3>Guards the Breaches</h3>
      <p>You have an innate ability to fortify and protect physical and metaphysical boundaries. Whether reinforcing a town's defenses or sealing interdimensional rifts, your skills make you an invaluable guardian against the encroachment of otherworldly threats. Your presence alone can create a shield against dark forces.</p>
      <h3>Lets Nightmares In</h3>
      <p>You possess the ominous ability to let nightmares seep into reality, allowing these harrowing visions to not only haunt the minds of those around you but physically manifest to harm others. Lesser nightmares are mindless, while more powerful nightmares have an agenda of their own and are more difficult to control.</p>
      <h3>Replaces flesh with Steel</h3>
      <p>You possess the remarkable ability to replace parts of your mortal frame with steel, crafting intricate augmentations that are powered by the steady hiss of steam. Fueled by the melding of human ingenuity and the power of steam, these enhancements grant you increased strength, resilience, and unique abilities. However, the fusion of flesh and steel is a delicate balance, and maintaining this mechanical prowess demands both skill and vigilance.</p>
      <h3>Wears the Skinchanger's Pelt</h3>
      <p>You possess a magical pelt that allows you to transform into a specific animal. Whether it's a wolf, bear, or bird of prey, this pelt grants you the abilities and instincts of the chosen creature. Be cautious, though, as the more you use this power, the harder it becomes to retain your human identity.</p>
      <h3>Saws bones and Stitches Flesh</h3>
      <p>You are a macabre surgeon, skilled in both medical and necromantic arts. Using a combination of surgical instruments and dark rituals, you can manipulate bones and flesh to heal injuries, reanimate the dead, or even create grotesque hybrid creatures. Your methods may be unsettling, but they yield results that defy the laws of nature.</p>
      <h3>Works Miracles</h3>
      <p>Blessed with divine favor or supernatural gifts, you have the ability to perform miracles. Whether healing the sick, turning water into wine, or even raising the dead, your actions are accompanied by an otherworldly aura. The source of your power may be a higher being, ancient relics, or an innate connection to the divine.</p>
      <h3>Seeks Revenge</h3>
      <p>You are a revenant, a vengeful spirit returned from the afterlife with a singular purpose: to exact revenge upon those who wronged you in life. You no longer need to eat or drink, and you </p>
      <h3>Wields Black Blood</h3>
      <p>Your veins course with a mysterious, supernatural substance known as black blood. This substance grants you various powers, from enhanced strength and agility to the ability to corrupt or poison those who come into contact with it. Harnessing the power of your black blood requires careful control, as its malevolent nature can be as much a danger to you as to your enemies.</p>
